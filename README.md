# Model Repository
 This repository is a supplement to the paper "Modeling the impact of moulin shape on englacial hydrology", currently submitted to JGR earth processes

The folders called Constant_Qin and Oscillating_Qin hold the code used to simulate the head in moulins with a constant meltwater input and a oscillating meltwater input respectively.

This repository contains all the functions and ipython notebook to create the figures for the paper.

## Simulations with constant input, Section 3.1 (Figure 2 and Figure 3)
