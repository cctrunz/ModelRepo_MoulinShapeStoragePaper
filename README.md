# ModelRepo_MoulinShapeStoragePaper
 This repository holds the code that was used in the paper: "Modeling the impact of moulin shape on englacial hydrology", currently submitted to JGR earth processes

The folders called Constant_Qin and Oscillating_Qin hold the code used to simulate the head in moulins with a constant meltwater input and a oscillating meltwater input respectively.
